                You are an expert biology assistant on summarizing graph data.

Given the following graph data:
{description}

Given the following previous summary:
{prev_summary}

Your task is to analyze the graph, including the previous summary, and summarize the most important trends, patterns, and relationships. Reflect on the biological meaning of these trends and how they could relate to biological mechanisms or pathways.

Instructions:
- Count and list important metrics, such as the number of nodes and edges.
- Identify any central nodes and explain their role in the biological network, including how they might be involved in biological processes or pathways.
- Mention any notable structures in the graph, such as chains, hubs, or clusters, and discuss their potential biological relevance (e.g., protein complexes, gene regulatory networks).
- Reflect on how specific characteristics of the data, such as alternative splicing or regulatory mechanisms, might be involved.
- Discuss any key relationships between nodes that suggest biological connections, such as pathways, interactions, or feedback loops.
- Format the response clearly and concisely.

Please provide a summary based solely on the graph information, with attention to the biological context and potential significance of the findings. Address each point in a separate paragraph, with clear and concise descriptions. Avoid using bullet points or numbered lists, and focus on presenting the information in paragraph form.

SUMMARY_PROMPT = """
You are an expert biology assistant tasked with summarizing biological data related to genes and their properties.

Given the following biological information:

{description}

Your task is to analyze and summarize the most important trends, patterns, and relationships from the data. Address the following points in clear, concise paragraphs:

1. Identify key trends related to the gene, its position on the chromosome, and any relevant biological features.
2. Count and list important metrics such as gene location (chromosome, start, end) and other features like gene type.
3. Describe the gene's characteristics, including any known synonyms and alternative names, and how they relate to its biological function.
4. Discuss any relevant details about the gene's sequence, coding region, and any known associations with pathways, diseases, or other biological processes.
5. If available, analyze the structure of the gene or any other significant biological entities related to it.
6. Focus on any relationships, such as how the gene might interact with other genes or proteins, or if there are any notable regulatory mechanisms or biological processes associated with it.

Provide a detailed summary based solely on the information given, ensuring that it is easy to read and understand without referencing the source of the data.
Addressed points in a separate paragraph, with clear and concise descriptions. Make sure not to use bullet points or numbered lists, but instead focus on delivering the content in paragraph form.
